## Replication Package Template - README.md

This README template is part of the guidelines for publishing Replication Packages. It contains all the necessary information that can help researchers reproduce your research effectively. The template was constructed based on the best practices for reproducing research [^1], but it is flexible and can be modified according to your specific research needs. If you have any comments or recommendations, you can create an issue in this repository.

## Template starts here ðŸ‘‡

<h1 align = "center"> "Research name": Replication Package </h1>

Include a short overview of the available code and materials, including the name of the research, the author names and the following text: If you run into any troubles running this code or reproducing results, please create an Issue in this repository.

## Related materials

Include the links to related knowledge materials:

- ðŸ“Š Dataset: [Dataset Name](https://mydata.iadb.org/)
- ðŸ“– Publication: [Publication Name](https://publications.iadb.org/en/)

## Data Availability Statement 

Include all the information about the data sources used in the replication package. You can also include any additional information that is necessary to obtain the data. These may include required registrations, memberships, application procedures, monetary cost, or other qualifications.

## Instructions to replicators

Explain the basic steps on how to reproduce the research results. In this section, it is recommended to use bullet points to provide details about which scripts should be opened and in what order. Please note that replication packages typically do not require any manual intervention from the user. They usually include a master script that enables the replication of all the results.

### Dependencies and Computational Requirements

This section should specifically contain:
- The computer hardware specification as used by the researcher (Operating system, RAM memory and disk space.)
- The project's software and libraries (statistical or programming software used, libraries,specific versions of libraries, package and dependency management software, SDKs and compilers, etc.)
- Time required to run all the scripts and generate the results.
