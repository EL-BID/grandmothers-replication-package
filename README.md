## Instructions to replicators

Globals needed to run individual do-files are in ‚ÄúA Run All.do‚Äù. If you open the do file directly from the folder, then the first four lines will adjust the path to that of your computer. This do file will run all the codes for the figures and tables, but each can be executed separately after running the global lines. The folders Tables and Figures will have the output of the do-file.

Folders:
- Code: Folder with do files for tables and figures in the paper and Appendix
- Data: Data is stored in mydata.iadb.org. 
- Figures: Folder necessary for replication containing the tables of the paper 
- Tables: Tables necessary for replication containing the figures of the paper
- DataMethodology: Document with the methodology used to build the dataset  ‚Äú3GenPanel.dta‚Äù
- Variables: Dictionary of variables of  ‚Äú3GenPanel.dta‚Äù
